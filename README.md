# Quarto Report Templates

This is a collection of templates for writing academic reports using Quarto. The existing templates are designed to be useful for course papers and short reports. For journal articles or longer papers, you may need to modify these templates. The basic idea is that you can write your report using standard Quarto-flavor Markdown, which has a pretty straightforward learning curve, and then use other tools (Typst, LaTeX, etc.) to compile the document into a PDF.

## Available Templates

### LaTeX

The LaTeX template is located in the `latex` folder. Follow the instructions in the `latex/README.md` file to use this template.
