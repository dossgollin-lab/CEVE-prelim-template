## How to Use This Template

This is a template for the Rice University Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEVE) preliminary exam.

### Installation

You'll need to install the following software to use this template:

1. [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) - the main software for rendering the document.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - a code editor that works well with Quarto. You can use other text editors, but VS Code is recommended.

Excellent tutorials are available for both tools.

### Cloning this Template

1. Assuming you have a GitHub account, follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) to create a new repository from this template.
1. Change the settings of your new repository **to make it private.**
1. Clone the new repository to your local machine using Git.
1. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
1. Edit the title and author information in the YAML header at the top of the document.

### Rendering the Document

There are two ways to render the document:

- **Preview** the document to get a quick, real-time view of the changes you make.
  1. Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`).
  2. Type `quarto preview report.qmd` and hit enter. It will open a new tab in your browser with the rendered document. You can arrange the text editor and the browser side by side for easy editing and previewing.

- **Render** the document to create a final version in PDf format.
  1. Open the command palette in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
  2. Select "Quarto: Render Document"
  3. Select "Render PDF" from the options
  4. Open `report.pdf` in the same folder as this document to see the final version.

## How to Write Your Report

Quarto Markdown is a simple and powerful way to write documents.
All referencing, page layout, and margin  settings are done using template settings that you don't need to edit.
That lets you focus on writing your report.

For example, you can use Markdown to create sections and subsections.
We use `##` for sections, `###` for subsections, and `####` for subsubsections.
The number of `#` symbols indicates the level of the section.
Section formatting is done automatically, so you don't need to worry about it.

### Some Best Practices

It's good practice to put each sentence on its own line of code.
This makes it easier to use tools like `git` to track changes over time.
This template uses this practice, so you can see how it works.

You should commit your changes to Git regularly and push them to your GitHub repository.
You will not be given extra time if you accidentally delete your work.

### Using References

This is a subsection.

It's easy to use references in Quarto Markdown.
Just say something, then add the citation [@keisler_gnn:2022;@kratzert_lstm:2018].
These make use of the citation key -- see [here](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/lab-guide/posts/2024-08-15-zotero.html) for more information on using Zotero, Better BibTeX, and citation keys.
See more on Quarto citations [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html).

For a tutorial on creating `.bib` files with Zotero, see [this tutorial](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/lab-guide/posts/2024-08-15-zotero.html).

### Equations

This is another subsection

Equations are really easy, just like this:
$$
E = mc^2
$$
We can also label equations:
The [Quarto Docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#equations) give this example.
Black-Scholes (@eq-black-scholes) is a mathematical model that seeks to explain the behavior of financial derivatives, most commonly options:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathrm C}{ \partial \mathrm t } + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2} \mathrm S^{2}
\frac{\partial^{2} \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S^2}
  + \mathrm r \mathrm S \frac{\partial \mathrm C}{\partial \mathrm S}\ =
  \mathrm r \mathrm C 
$$ {#eq-black-scholes}
We can also use inline equations, like this: $\sin(x) \approx x$ for $x \approx 0$.
For systems of equations, we can use the `aligned` environment.
This is useful for writing equations that are aligned at the equals sign.

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 + y^2 &= z^2 \\
x^2 - y^2 &= (x+y)(x-y)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Adding Figures

As discussed in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html), you can add figures to the document.
You may use figures that you created, or figures that you found from external sources (provided they are properly cited).
There are advanced options for setting width, adding captions, and cross-referencing, so use these appropriately.

![A figure caption goes here](fig/ERCOT_HDD_blog.jpg){#fig-ercot-hdd width=4.5in}

You can cross-reference figures and numbers will automatically be updated, as in @fig-ercot-hdd.

### Learn More

This is not a comprehensive guide to Quarto.
See the [Quarto tutorials](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/jupyter.html) to learn about other features.

## Preliminary Exam Policies

You have received a copy of the questions.
**Requirements, evaluation criteria, suggested structure, and helpful resources are covered in the Rice CEVE Graduate Student Handbook.**

Formatting requirements (1.5 line spacing, 11 point font[^font], 1 inch margins) specified in the 2024--2025 handbook are already implemented in this template, but you should confirm that the final document meets these requirements and check the handbook for any updates.
References, the abstract, and the title page are not included in the page count.
You are responsible for ensuring that the final document meets all formatting requirements.

[^font]: The handbook says 12 point font, but all examples I have seen use 11 point font. Consider this your official permission to use 11 point font.

### AI Policy

The use of AI tools for this exam **is strictly prohibited**, with the exception of the following:

1. Literature review: you may use *specialized* online tools to help you find relevant literature (e.g., Google Scholar; elicit.org) and help you understand relevant literature (e.g., NotebookLM). However, you are responsible for any content you include in your exam, and you must read and understand all material you cite. You **may not** use general-purpose AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) for these purposes.
2. LaTeX math syntax: you may use *specialized* online tools, such as MathPix, to help you write LaTeX math syntax. However, you are responsible for any content you include in your exam, and you must read and understand all material you include. You **may not** use general-purpose AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) or any tools that are capable of providing feedback on the accuracy of your equations for these purposes.
3. Grammarly: you may use Grammarly to help with proofreading and grammar checking. To use Grammarly, follow the directions to render the document, but render to Word format instead of PDF. Upload the file to Grammarly, then make suggested changes in your Quarto document.

If you use any of the above tools, you must include a section at the end of your exam (not included in the page limit) listing the tools you used and how you used them.

If you have any questions about whether a specific use of AI is allowed, please ask Dr. Doss-Gollin before proceeding.
Please note that this policy specifically includes, but is not limited to, the use of online tools like ChatGPT or Gemini as well as tools built into the IDE you are using.
You must turn off autocomplete and other AI features in your IDE.[^turnoff]

[^turnoff]: In Visual Studio Code, you can turn off autocomplete by going to Settings ({{< kbd Ctrl+, >}} or {{< kbd Cmd+, >}}), going to "Workspace settings" (rather than "User settings"), searching for `inlineSuggest`, and uncheck the box. The configuration file implementing this setting is included in this repository, so this should work automatically.

### Rice Honor Code

This exam is governed by the Rice Honor Code.
You are expected to follow the guidelines outlined in the [Rice Honor Code](https://honor.rice.edu/).
